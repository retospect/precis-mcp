"""Core types for the prompt assembler (ADR 0038).

A prompt is a list of **modules** grouped into two cache layers. Each
module yields zero or one **block** of text at assembly time; the
assembler orders them and an **adapter** packages the blocks for one
runner (system/user split, prefix ordering, …).

This module holds the value types only — no store access, no rendering
logic — so it imports cleanly from anywhere (``tables``, ``assembler``,
``adapters``, and the per-site module lists all depend on it).

Two module kinds (ADR 0038 §2):

* **Static** — body is a constant string (mechanics, the planner
  contract, a persona). Modelled as a :class:`Module` whose ``build``
  ignores the context and returns the literal.
* **Computed** — body is generated from live state and usually rendered
  as a TOON table (``doc_context``, ``tools``, ``kinds``, ``glossary``).
  Modelled as a :class:`Module` whose ``build`` queries the context.

The uniform ``build(ctx) -> str | None`` shape lets the assembler treat
both identically: it calls ``build``, drops the module when the result
is falsy, and tags the surviving text with the module's ``layer``.
