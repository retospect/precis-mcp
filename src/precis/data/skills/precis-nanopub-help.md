# precis-nanopub-help — the published identity of a taproot claim

A reviewed taproot claim can be **minted** as a nanopublication: a
signed, content-addressed TriG artifact (trusty URI under
`https://w3id.org/np/`) whose provenance carries only universal anchors
— DOI, `pdf_sha256` of the exact quoted copy, a verbatim quote, and a
normalized `searchSnip` that locates the passage in any copy. Taproot
stays authoritative; the nanopub is the frozen published form.

## What an agent can do

- `get(kind='finding', id='fi<id>', view='nanopub')` — the TriG
  rendering. Pre-mint you get an **unsigned draft** (placeholder URI,
  `#` status comments; missing grounding is flagged, not invented).
  Once signed you get the **exact frozen bytes** plus a comment header
  naming the trusty URI and the `nanopub_artifacts` row that holds the
  authoritative copy.
- Read the header's publish state: `candidate → reviewed → signed →
  anchored → published → superseded/retracted` (`rejected` off
  `reviewed`). A hub with a live `contradicts` edge renders an
  UNMINTABLE warning — disputed claims are visible internally,
  unpublishable externally, until adjudicated by artifacts.

## What an agent must NOT do

- **Minting, signing and anchoring are not agent verbs.** `precis
  nanopub approve/sign/anchor` is run by a person; the attesting key is
  invocable only from that interactive surface. A bot signature alone
  never publishes anything.
- Never edit a hub that shows `reviewed` or later state to "fix" its
  wording — the approved string is frozen; an edit flips the row back
  for re-review (pre-publication) or forces a public supersede
  (post-publication). Propose the change instead.

## Mint gates (why a claim you drafted may not mint)

Layer-A validators run at approve and again at sign; the common
failures an extraction agent can avoid up front:

- **Primary sources only** — grounding whose chunk lives in a
  references list / related-work / prior-art / background section is
  hearsay and rejected, even when the quote checks out. Cite the paper
  that DID the work; if only a secondhand mention is held, the claim
  stays *hanging* (mintable, unpublishable) while the original is
  hunted.
- **No source, no atom** — every claim needs its own verbatim quote
  plus a snip that matches uniquely in the paper's stored text.
- **Quantities carry bound semantics** — `exact` / `upper` / `lower` /
  `approx-range`; "up to 400:1" and "400:1" are different claims.
- **Structured fields must be quote-contained** — a
  material/method/quantity value the quotes don't state is an
  overclaim.
- **Compounds are derivations** — conjunct-of atoms minted first; the
  compound cites atoms, never papers. Cross-binding (a property from
  system B on a phenomenon from system A) is new content: it needs its
  own evidence or mints as a `precis:Hypothesis` (declarative sentence,
  type carries the epistemic status, `testableBy` names the
  discriminating experiment).
