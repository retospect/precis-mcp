title: precis — PCB measures (the measuring tapes)
summary: state placement & layout intent as measures the autoplacer optimises and the eyes evaluate — keep the regulator away from the antenna, the bypass cap AT the pin, this part under 3mm tall. Covers separation, proximity, height, role-based selection, hard/soft/gauge strength.
answers:
  - how do I state placement or layout intent as a measure the autoplacer can optimise?
  - how do I evaluate a design's current measures?
  - how do measures interact with placement?

# precis-measures-help — design intent as measuring tapes

A **measure** is a stretch of intent between parts of a `pcb` design — "keep
these apart", "keep this close", "stay under this height". The autoplacer
**optimises** the soft/hard ones and the eyes **evaluate** all of them
(`view='measures'`). They make the *why* of a layout explicit and checkable
instead of hiding it in coordinates. Add them in the `measures` array of `put`
([[precis-pcb-help]]).

```python
put(
    kind="pcb",
    id="s",
    args={
        "measures": [
            {
                "metric": "separation",
                "operands": [{"role": "sensitive"}, {"role": "noisy"}],
                "goal": 10,
                "strength": "soft",
                "reason": "keep the mic preamp off the switching regulator",
            },
            {
                "metric": "proximity",
                "operands": [{"instance": "C1"}, {"instance": "U1"}],
                "goal": 2,
                "strength": "hard",
                "reason": "VDD bypass must sit right at the pin",
            },
            {
                "metric": "height",
                "operands": [{"role": "under_lid"}],
                "goal": 3.0,
                "strength": "gauge",
                "reason": "clearance under the enclosure lid",
            },
        ]
    },
)
```

## Anatomy

- **metric** — what's measured (table below).
- **operands** — the parts it spans, selected by **instance** (`{'instance':
  'U1'}`) or by **role class** (`{'role':'sensitive'}` → every instance tagged
  `sensitive`). Role selection is the power move: tag parts `roles:['noisy']` /
  `['sensitive']` / `['under_lid']` at `put` time, then write one measure over
  the class.
- **goal** — the target value (mm for geometry).
- **strength** — `hard` (must hold; heavily penalised in placement), `soft`
  (optimised, traded against crossings/length), `gauge` (measured + reported
  only, never drives placement — a ruler, not a constraint).
- **direction** — optional: which side of `goal` is ok. `min`/`keep_above`
  (value must stay ≥ goal), `max`/`keep_below` (≤ goal), `target` (aim at
  goal, ±10%). Without it each metric keeps its natural sense (the table
  below). Flips both the verdict *and* the placement pull.
- **weight** — optional: scales a soft measure's pull (default 1.0;
  `weight: 0` records the measure without letting it steer placement).
- **reason** — required-in-spirit free text; this is the design rationale the
  next reader (or you, later) needs.

## Metrics

| metric | evaluates | drives placement | use for |
|--------|-----------|------------------|---------|
| `separation` | min centroid gap ≥ goal | **yes** | keep noisy ↔ sensitive apart |
| `proximity` | max centroid gap ≤ goal | **yes** | bypass cap at the pin; crystal at the MCU |
| `height` | each part's height ≤ goal | reports | fit under a lid / next to a connector |
| `parallelism` | bus traces run together | pending | I²C/SPI grouping (phase 2) |
| `supply_path` | short/low-Z power route | pending | power integrity (phase 2) |
| `topology` | net wiring order | pending | daisy-chain vs star (phase 2) |
| `plane_continuity` | unbroken return | pending | ground integrity (phase 2) |
| `thermal` | spread heat | pending | regulators / LEDs (phase 2) |

The first three (the placement-geometry ones) **evaluate now**; the
connectivity metrics are **stored and reported `pending`** until their
evaluators land — write them anyway, they document intent and will light up
later.

## Evaluate — `get(view='measures')`

```python
get(kind="pcb", id="s", view="measures")
# metric · strength · goal · value · verdict(ok/violated/pending) · reason
```

A `hard` violation is a real problem; a `soft` one is a tradeoff the placer
made; a `gauge` row is just information. Re-run after `autoplace` to see what
held.

## How measures interact with placement

The production anneal (the enqueued `op='place'` job, and `op='route'`'s
re-place pass) prices each `soft`/`hard` proximity & separation measure as
a cost term: zero when satisfied, growing linearly with violation-mm, with
`hard` weighted ~40× `soft`. So measures **steer** the layout, they don't
post-hoc reject it — a `hard` measure is a strong pull, not a legality
wall, and on a congested board it can still lose (read `view='measures'`
after placing to see what held). The quick `autoplace` path prices them
too (`W_MEASURE·penalty`). `fixed` parts (connectors, mounting holes)
still never move regardless. See [[precis-pcb-help]] for the place loop.

## Idioms

- **Bypass at the pin:** `proximity` `hard`, cap ↔ IC, goal ~2 mm. (See
  [[precis-decoupling-help]].)
- **Quiet analog:** tag the preamp `sensitive`, the regulator/MCU `noisy`, one
  `separation` `soft` between the roles.
- **Fits the box:** tag lid-side parts `under_lid`, one `height` `gauge`.
- **Crystal hugs the MCU:** `proximity` `hard`, crystal ↔ MCU, small goal —
  and the load caps get their own `proximity` `hard` onto the crystal.
