"""Text normalisation for citation metadata verification (Phase 2.5).

See ``docs/provenance-kind-plan.md`` § "Phase 2.5: citation metadata
verification" for the design rationale. Two normalised forms are
produced for each string; comparison succeeds if either form matches.

Pipeline:

1. ``unicodedata.normalize('NFKD', s)`` — decomposes diacritics,
   sub/superscripts, ligatures, full-width forms, compatibility forms.
2. Strip combining characters.
3. Lowercase.
4. Replace every non-alphanumeric char with a space.
5. Collapse whitespace.
6. Tokenise (split on whitespace).
7. Drop English stopwords.

The German-phonetic alternative form applies ``ä→ae, ö→oe, ü→ue,
ß→ss`` before step 1, so ``Müller`` produces tokens ``{muller}``
under NFKD-strip and ``{mueller}`` under the phonetic alt — a
surname matches if either set lines up against the comparison
target.

The token-set Jaccard metric is invariant to word order, articles,
subtitle separators, and markup leakage, while still penalising
substantive word differences (the actual signal we want when
catching wrong-paper citations).

Greek letters used semantically (``β-cell`` vs ``beta-cell``) and
math symbols (``≤``, ``±``) are deliberately *not* mapped — NFKD
doesn't touch them and a hand-built table has too many edge cases.
The diff stays visible in the report; the rendering model judges.
