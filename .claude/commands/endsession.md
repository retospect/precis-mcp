You are wrapping up a worktree session. The goal of a feature branch is to
land on `main`. **Shipping is a script, not a set of LLM steps** — one
`scripts/ship` run does commit → sync → gate → squash-merge → local-main
fast-forward deterministically, which is faster, reproducible, and
token-cheap. Your job is only to (a) supply a good commit message and
(b) handle anything the script can't (a real merge conflict or a red gate).

Live state at invocation:

- Branch + status:
  !`git -c color.ui=never status -sb`
- Commits this branch is ahead of main:
  !`git -c color.ui=never log --oneline origin/main..HEAD 2>/dev/null || git -c color.ui=never log --oneline main..HEAD`

Optional ship message from the user: `$ARGUMENTS`

## Procedure

1. **Decide the message.** If `$ARGUMENTS` is non-empty, use it. Otherwise
   write a concise one-line, conventional-commit-style summary of what this
   branch changes (look at the diff vs `main` if unsure).

2. **Run the script.** It is idempotent — re-running after a fix resumes
   cleanly.
   ```
   scripts/ship "<message>"
   ```
   `scripts/ship` does, in order: refuse-if-on-main + set the git-town parent
   → commit any WIP → `git town sync` → **integration gate against this
   worktree** in the precis-dev container (it auto-fixes ruff `--fix` +
   `format` and amends them, then runs the authoritative
   `ruff · format · mypy · pytest`) → squash-merge to `main` via `commit-tree`
   + a `--force-with-lease` CAS push → delete the remote feature branch →
   fast-forward the local `main` → print the new `main` sha.

3. **Handle failures.** The script exits non-zero and prints a `✖` line only
   on something it can't do mechanically:
   - **Merge conflict during sync** — resolve the conflict, `git town
     continue`, then re-run `scripts/ship`.
   - **Red gate (mypy/pytest)** — the failure is printed above the `✖`. Ruff
     lint/format drift is auto-fixed, so a ruff failure here means an
     *unfixable* lint error. Fix the code and re-run. Only real failures in
     branch-touched code block the ship; a lone `UniqueViolation` /
     stale-row error in an unrelated test is usually shared-`precis_test`
     pollution — clean the stray row and re-run.
   - **CAS push rejected** — a sibling worktree shipped first; just re-run
     `scripts/ship` (it re-syncs onto the new `main`).
   - A `WARNING:` about the primary `main` not fast-forwarding is
     **best-effort, not a ship failure** (the remote is already updated) —
     just relay it so the human can `git merge --ff-only origin/main` in the
     primary worktree.

4. **Report.** On success, print the new `main` commit the script emitted and
   a one-line summary of what shipped.

> **Why a script instead of `git town ship`.** `git town ship` runs
> `git checkout main`, which always fails from a linked worktree (`main` is
> already checked out in the primary). And `./scripts/dev` bind-mounts the
> **main** repo at `/app`, so a naive gate would test `main`, not your edits.
> `scripts/ship` works around both (worktree bind-mount + `commit-tree`/CAS-push
> plumbing) and is race-safe against sibling sessions shipping concurrently
> onto the shared `.git`.
