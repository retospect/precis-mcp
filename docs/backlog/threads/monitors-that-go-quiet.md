# monitors that go quiet

**Status:** ends when main always has a verdict and every fleet alert is
addressable by failure id and host identity, so silence means healthy. Four
things landed 2026-09-30: main-ci-status no longer announces either conclusion
off a cached listing; a main push is gated against the delta since the last sha
with a real shard verdict; qland runs ruff+mypy before it merges; and a host
dark past log retention still pages, because the detector no longer bounds
itself to a table the sweeper prunes. Two more landed the same day: a CLI that
exited 0 while printing a refusal now exits 3 on stderr, and the fix_gripe lane
stopped reporting deliveries it had not made — a fix branch counts as delivered
only once `git ls-remote` finds it on the repo's real upstream, which the lane
had never once reached. What remains is one signal that lies by omission (a
worker host no detector can see), one decision on whether a lane that cannot
deliver should keep running, and one held decision on how far
behind its verdict main may drift before a qland is refused. The container host's forensics were
answered before the 30-day prune took them; what they turned up — an
unattributable identity claiming and failing prod jobs — is bigger than this
thread and is flagged on the Horizon for an owner.

## Do next

1. **The fix_gripe lane cannot deliver, and nobody has decided whether it
   should keep running** — the false-success half is fixed (see Status), so
   the lane now fails honestly instead of parking gripes behind branches that
   do not exist. But it fails *every time*: the worker's checkout is an
   anonymous HTTPS clone with no push credential, so no fix attempt can reach
   the upstream. Three ways out, and the choice is not mine: give the worker a
   push credential, publish the diff to the gripe instead of a branch, or stop
   scheduling the lane until one of those exists. Until then every run costs
   agent budget and delivers nothing. First because a lane that burns money to
   produce failures is a live cost, and because the 43 stranded branches lose
   their value as main moves away from them.
2. **backlog/unnamed-container-host-wrote-211k-worker-logs.md** — its ask 1,
   the attributability journal: one event when a non-fleet identity starts
   writing to prod, carrying whatever provenance exists. The investigation
   half is CLOSED as of 2026-09-30 (answers in the item, read before the prune
   took them), so what is left is the monitor. Second: it is the only open
   code work here that is mine to start, but nothing is specced yet and the
   thing it would watch is not currently costing anything.
3. **backlog/main-stays-gated.md** — one follow-on, and it is a question
   rather than a task: how far behind its last shard verdict main may drift
   before `scripts/ship --quick` refuses rather than warns. Both directions
   are written up in the item; it wants Reto's number, then it is a few lines.

## Horizon

1. **A guard on whether an ephemeral identity may claim jobs at all** — ask 2
   of the container item, and unfiled as its own thing because it may not
   belong here: it is prod-work integrity, not a monitor. Evidence from the
   2026-09-30 forensics: the container claimed 53 nursery jobs and failed all
   53, plus 16 axis jobs likewise, under an identity nobody can contact,
   alert on, or trace once `worker_logs` prunes. Needs an owner thread before
   it can be ranked — flagged here so it is not lost with the item whose
   investigation half just closed.
2. **backlog/alert-failure-id-registry.md** — status ready; stable failure
   ids make "did host-dark fire, for which host" addressable instead of SQL
   archaeology. Leverage over Do-next 2 and shippable now.
3. **backlog/self-healing-spine.md** — Layer 1 owns worker identity, Layer 2
   the condition registry; Do-next 2 exists because a host has no
   durable identity separating "ephemeral by design" from "vanished", so
   attributability-by-container is a slice here. Last: largest, no
   independently shippable piece touching this thread.

## Parked

- (none)

## No action needed

- **gr458317** — fixed 2026-09-30, pending close. `precis tools` sent an
  `[error:…]` refusal to stdout at exit 0; it now goes to stderr at exit 3,
  kept distinct from 1 (the CLI crashed) so a caller can tell "the verb said
  no" from "the tool is broken". The gripe's one unaudited risk is clear:
  nothing in the tree calls `precis tools` or `prod-precis` programmatically.
  Fixing it turned up the same defect in `precis eval` — right exit code,
  wrong stream, and no check at all for a rendered refusal string, so that
  case also exited 0 — so the contract now lives in
  `precis.cli._common.is_refusal` / `REFUSAL_EXIT` and both commands share it.
- **gr456236** — fixed 2026-09-30, pending close: the staleness guard now
  runs on the green verdict too and prints even under `--for-hook`. Landed
  from the gripe's own diagnosis, not from the auto-fix lane's branch
  (`gripe_456236` was gone from origin by the time it was reviewed).
- **gr346534** — the post-merge-run gripe gr456236 cites; soft-deleted, do
  not chase.
- **the cancelled-run verdict hole** — closed 2026-09-30 by
  `scripts/last-gated-main-sha` + check.yml's main-push range. The range can
  only widen, so the failure direction is over-gating; a lookup that cannot
  answer gates fully.
- **host-dark ageing out with worker_logs retention** — closed 2026-09-30.
  `_detect_host_dark` no longer reads `worker_logs` at all; a decommissioned
  host is excluded by an explicit `meta.retired` stamp
  (`precis heartbeat --retire <host>`, which refuses a host still beating
  because the heartbeat UPSERT would clear the marker on its next beat).
  `HOST_DARK_LOOKBACK_DAYS` is gone. The durable pin is structural, not a
  number: a test asserts the detector's code never mentions `worker_logs`.
- **qland as the gate bypass** — closed 2026-09-30: `scripts/ship --quick`
  runs ruff + mypy + import contracts before the squash-merge (no pytest, no
  test DB, no fleet gate slot), and the qland skill now says to run the tests
  you added. CLAUDE.md, the qland skill and the qgo skill were all telling
  agents qland ran nothing, so they changed in the same commit.
